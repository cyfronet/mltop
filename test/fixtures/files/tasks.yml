MT:
  name: Machine translation
  info: |
    Converts text from one language to another, maintaining the meaning and
    context of the original message. This task involves translating between
    languages like English to French or Polish to Spanish and aims to ensure
    both grammatical and semantic accuracy.

    Machine Translation (MT) involves translating text between languages, aiming to produce accurate and contextually relevant output.
    Neural MT systems, such as transformer models, have replaced earlier statistical and rule-based approaches by offering more fluent translations.
    Neural MT can be adapted to specialized fields like legal or medical content, enabling more precise translations.
    A key challenge lies in handling idiomatic expressions, ambiguous terms, and cultural nuances while maintaining the style of the original text.
    MT models today support low-resource languages and multilingual translation, including zero-shot translation, where they translate unseen language pairs.
    These systems have become essential for global communication, e-commerce, and customer support.
    MT continues to evolve, with research focusing on real-time applications, better handling of domain-specific terms, and multimodal translation that considers both text and visual data.
